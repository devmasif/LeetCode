<h2> Integer To Roman </h2>

<b> Level: Medium </b>

https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/description/

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>I</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>V</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>X</td><td>10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>L</td><td>50</td></tr>
    <tr><td>C</td><td>100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>D</td><td>500</td></tr>
    <tr><td>M</td><td>1000</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.

If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).

Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 3749

Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places


Example 2:

Input: num = 58

Output: "LVIII"

Explanation:

50 = L
8 = VIII


Example 3:

Input: num = 1994

Output: "MCMXCIV"

Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999
